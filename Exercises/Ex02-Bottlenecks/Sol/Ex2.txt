An atomic operation? Atomicity is a guarantee of isolation from concurrent processes. 
A semaphore? A way to limit the number of consumers for a specific resource (like a gate or bouncer).
A mutex? Like a semaphore only exlusive to one user, semaphores can count higher than one.
A critical section? Part of a multi-process program that may not be concurrently executed by more than one of the program's processes

C: mutex allows only one thread, semaphores may allow several


Msg passing vs. shared var: Msg passing saves us the problem of dealing with keeping track of who can write to what and when, but shared memory gives faster performance.
